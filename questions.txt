Director of Marketing at Nike

We want to increase brand awareness among Gen Z.

Currently our social media engagement among Gen Z has been declining 6% quarterly, with engagement on Facebook and Instagram declining the most.

We have access to social media analytics (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, TikTok), product reviews, and regional sales data.

Our team is somewhat familiar with AI, and eager to learn more.

Right now we don't have a great way of streamlined analysis of our social media trends to predict where we should invest for engagement.

We are struggling the most to reach Gen Z customers.

We measure the success of marketing campaigns based on ad watch time and click-through rates to our online store.

Our main competitors are Under Armor and Lululemon. We differentiate ourselves through our strong brand awareness.

We would like to emulate Under Armor's recent social media campaign.

Customers usually find out about product launches through social media, and click through to buy products.

We have limited personalization for customers currently.
