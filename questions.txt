Director of Development for NYC Education Enablement Consultancy Firm

Works mostly with principals (clients) and teachers. Principals looking to improve student achievement, engagement via improving teacher practice/coaching

Use quarterly OKRs around teaching efficiency and NPS

Pain points: 1) Staffing (NYC DOE is unpredictable, budgets fluctuate, hard to predict where work will occur). Hard to estimate volume/location of work to staff Coaches appropriately. Balancing Coach, staff time. 2) Trainings are expensive but useful, understanding when to target trainings, retreat days, community building, general work is very isolated by school. 3) Content development time and capacity

Personal assistant for managing Coaches’ calendars, project management, develop and track items on work plans

Client calls sales team, expresses interest in support for teachers. Request is matched to Coach by Teaching Matters, who receives work estimate. Coach sets up meeting w/ Principal, follows up when no response (pain point). Coach creates, manages agenda docs for Teacher interviews, classroom observations, log time in salesforce. Repeats with a different school. 

Time is  a factor based on the conditions of the school to accelerate or hinder work

Data: NYC DOE data about school, # of kids, Achievement on tests, Disabilities, etc as well as notes taken from school observations

Very localized to NYC school system. Knows leaders, superintendents . Strong presence in city, will aligned w/ DOE. Room to broaden scope outside of NYC

Some AI tools we’ve been wanting to explore around data viz (used tableau in the past)

I'd love a personal assistant!
